\section{Razer SBUI SDK}
To develop apps for SBUI devices, you need to have the Razer SBUI SDK downloaded and installed on your system. The SDK can be downloaded from Razer's SBUI website: \url{http://developer.razerzone.com/sbui/sbui-sdk/}.

\section{Visual Studio}
The instructions and tutorials in this guide will assume that you are using Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop, which can be obtained for free from Microsoft's website: \url{http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop}.

\section{Installing the NuGet package manager}
(If you intend to download SharpBlade from a source other than NuGet, you can skip this section)

SharpBlade is distributed as a NuGet package, and as such, you'll need the NuGet package manager to install it. You can get it from their project page at: \url{http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget}

\section{Obtaining SharpBlade}
The easiest way to get SharpBlade is to install the NuGet package. Simply open the NuGet package manager console (Tools $\rightarrow$ Package Manager Console) and execute the following command: \c|Install-Package SharpBlade|. This will download the latest stable SharpBlade version and add it as a reference in your project.
