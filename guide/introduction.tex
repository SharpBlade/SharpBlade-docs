\chapter{Introduction}
This guide is meant for people just starting out with \gls{sbui} development and who may be beginners to the C\# language as well. Because of that, people with more experience in the field may find this guide slow paced, but we think it will still work good as an introduction to the SharpBlade library.

\section{Terminology and formatting}
Throughout this guide, we'll make references to both the SharpBlade \gls{api} and Razer \gls{sdk} \gls{api}, which is characterized by how the text is typeset. SharpBlade components are set in a \sbapi{bolded green font} and also link to the relevant documentation page at \url{http://sharpblade.net/docs} (only usable if you're viewing this online), while Razer \gls{sdk} components are shown with simply \rzapi{bolded font}, to match the style used in their own \gls{sdk} documents. General code that isn't closely associated with either framework is shown in a \c|normal typewriter font|.
