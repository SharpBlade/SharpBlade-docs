\chapter{Introduction}
This guide is meant for people just starting out with \gls{sbui} development and who may be beginners to the C\# language as well. Because of that, people with more experience in the field may find this guide slow paced, but we think it will still work good as an introduction to the SharpBlade library.

\section{Terminology and formatting}
Throughout this guide, we'll make references to both the SharpBlade \gls{api} and Razer \gls{sdk} \gls{api}, which is characterized by how the text is typeset. SharpBlade components are set in a \sbapi{bolded green font} and also link to the relevant documentation page at \url{http://sharpblade.net/docs} (only usable if you're viewing this online), while Razer \gls{sdk} components are shown with simply \rzapi{bolded font}, to match the style used in their own \gls{sdk} documents. General code that isn't closely associated with either framework is shown in a \c|normal typewriter font|.

\section{Automated SharpBlade documentation}
The documentation found at \url{http://sharpblade.net/docs} is automatically generated each time SharpBlade is built by our TeamCity build server (every time new code is pushed to the GitHub repository). This guide was written with the intent that the automated documentation should be accessible while reading through the examples in this guide.

Of course, we try to explain all the \gls{api} calls done in this guide and what they mean, but if you feel like you're missing something, make sure to look up the relevant function, method, class, struct or enum in the SharpBlade documentation, as it will have all the technical details and signature information. For things relating to the Razer \gls{api}, you can refer to the \gls{sdk} documentation that came with your Razer \gls{sdk} installation.

\chapter{Bugs and feedback}
Found a bug or have a feature request? Please create a new issue on GitHub describing the situation and any steps to reproduce it in the case of a bug report): \url{https://github.com/SharpBlade/SharpBlade/issues} (please do a search first to see if your issue has already been reported by someone else).

\chapter{Contact\label{chap:contact}}
Having problems getting SharpBlade to work? We will gladly help you get started! You can contact us personally, but try contacting the \gls{sbui} community via Razer's dev forum first. We frequent the forums, so it's very likely we'll get in touch with you over there, but with the added benefit that other members of the community can give their aid as well. Not to mention that other people having the same issue(s) as you can find the topic and get the help they need without having to contact us and wait for an answer!

You can find Razer's dev forums at: \url{http://developer.razerzone.com/forums/} (login with your Razer ID).

If you'd rather get in touch us directly, you can find contact information on our websites: \url{http://sharparam.com/} for Adam Hellberg (Sharparam) and \url{http://brandonscott.co.uk/} for Brandon JC Scott (brandonscott).
