SharpBlade documentation
========================

This repo contains *manually* written documentation for the [SharpBlade][] project.

This is mainly to have a more beginner friendly kind of guide to using SharpBlade, rather than the automated documentation which some might find overwhelming when just starting out.

The [automatically generated documentation][auto] can be found at the [project website][sbnet].

Building
--------

(Pre-built versions can be found linked on the [project website][sbnet])

The guide in **/guide/** is written using LaTeX, a full installation of LaTeX using the popular methods (TeXLive and MikTeX) should get you any packages needed. Simply run the `latex` command on `guide.tex` to build.
